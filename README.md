# se_archiveorg_link_restorer
Change all stackexchange and stackoverflow answer links to their archive.org snapshot on the date the answer was posted. This is a Tampermonkey script which can be installed on any major webbrowser.

For example, say you click on a link in a Stackoverflow answer, and it goes to a 404, or the contents of the page has changed drastically. This extension, when activated, will change all links in all answers on a Stackoverflow or StackExchange question to go to its archive.org snapshot from the date the answer was posted. Therefore, you will see what the author saw when they posted the link in their answer.
