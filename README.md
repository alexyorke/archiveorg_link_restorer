Change all links in Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow answers to their archive.org snapshot on the date the answer was posted This is a Tampermonkey script which can be installed on any major webbrowser.

For example, say you click on a link in a Stack Overflow answer, and it goes to a 404, or the contents of the page has changed drastically. This extension, when activated, will change all links in all answers on a Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange question to go to its archive.org snapshot from the date the answer was posted. Therefore, you will see what the author saw when they posted the link in their answer.
